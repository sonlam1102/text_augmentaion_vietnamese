# Simple Text augmentation using EDA techniques   
The purpose is to generate new instances from the original texts     
There are four different techniques: 
- Random Insertion (RI)    
- Random Swap (RS)    
- Random Deletion (RD)    
- Synonym replacement (SR)     

The wordnet used in this project are collected from this repository: https://github.com/zeloru/vietnamese-wordnet     
List of Vietnamese stopwords: https://github.com/stopwords/vietnamese-stopwords
